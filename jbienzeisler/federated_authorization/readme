AKTIN Infrastructure - R Scripts for Data Analysis and Visualization
Description
This repository contains R scripts used to generate key figures and tables for the manuscript:

"Pioneering Federated Data Access for a Learning Healthcare System: Implementation Report of the Federated Data Access Authorization System of the German National Emergency Department Data Registry"

The scripts produce the following outputs from the data published available from https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14509531:

Figure 4a and 4b:

Growth of the AKTIN Infrastructure:
Active Emergency Department (ED) nodes per year.
Accessible Electronic Health Records (EHRs) per year.
Figure 4c and 4d:

Query completion times:
Kaplan-Meier survival curves for individual query completion.
Hexbin density distribution of unanswered queries by node activity.
Supplementary Table 3:

Frequency analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs), including:
Time until query completion.
Time until query rejection.
Query processing times.
Files
create_figure_4ab.R: Script to create Figure 5a (ED nodes) and Figure 5b (accessible records).
create_figure_4cd.R: Script to create Figure 5c and 5d (query completion times and density).
create_supplementary_table_3.R: Script to generate Supplementary Table 3 (KPI frequency statistics).
data_analysis.csv: Input file with anonymized query log data.
